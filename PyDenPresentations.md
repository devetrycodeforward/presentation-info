## General theme:
You are presenting a technical **product** to a technical audience

## Outline:
1.  **Business case**:  Why does this thing exist?  What problem is it trying to solve? (no more than 30s)
    - Greenfield: Why did you make this from scratch?
    - Legacy portion: Why did you implement _your_ feature from scratch?

2.  **Tech used**:
    - Greenfield: Full stack
    - Legacy: To implement particular feature
    - Both: Cool tech used
        - Moment.JS
        - Drag & Drop
        - XML Parser
        - Vue Router
        - ...ect.

2.  **Challenges**:
    - What was **unusual** / difficult to implement?
    - What might a technical audience find _interesting_?
    - Any cases of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole?

3. **Next Steps**:
    - How might another engineer wanting to fork your project add to it?



## Potential Q/A Questions:

1. Why did you use Vue instead of React (or anything else you haven't learned yet)
    - **Acceptable Answer**: I haven't yet gotten the chance try React.

2. Why did you architect your app store X in a db instead of application state?
    - Generally, they are asking, why did you use this pattern instead of that pattern.
    - **Acceptable Answer**: [Try your best to justify your tech/business decisions]
